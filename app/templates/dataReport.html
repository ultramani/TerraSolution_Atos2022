                <p>
                    The feasibility of these supposed plantations has been based on the prediction of the pillars of
                    plant growth such as temperature, humidity, rainfall in the area, hours of light and a small soil
                    analysis. The prediction is made in terms of the number of months it takes for each type of plant to
                    grow to the point of harvesting,
                    basing these predictions on the average of the last 20 years of data.

                                This soil temperature is considered too low,which can prevent seed germination. In general, the colder the soil, the less nutrients and water accumulate in it, which affects the photosynthesis of the plant and ultimately the product it produces. It can also lead to the death of the plant due to lack of food.
                                It is recommended to postpone planting or mulch the soil to keep it warm.

                                This soil temperature is considered too high,which can result in stunted plant growth. In adult plants, this can result in root damage, loss of water and nutrients, and ultimately plant death or reduced yield and quality.
                                It is recommended to postpone planting or to moisten the soil to reduce the temperature by evaporation of water.

                                It is recommended to prepare the soil before planting by moistening it for several weeks.
